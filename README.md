# Project Overview

This project is a simple authentication flow using **Zustand** for state management, **TanstackQuery** (React Query) for mutation handling, **ShadCN** for UI components, and **Axios Mock Adapter** to simulate a mock API for authentication.

## Technologies Used:

- **Zustand**: State management solution for managing global state.
- **TanstackQuery (React Query)**: For performing mutations and data fetching.
- **ShadCN**: UI components library for modern and accessible components.
- **Axios Mock Adapter**: To simulate API calls for authentication without a real backend.
